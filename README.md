# learn_bloc_pattern

A new Flutter project that I created to learn the BLoC pattern for state management.

Some resources to learn from:

- [Flutter BLoC Pattern Tutorial by Reso Coder](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4jCBkrirvVGr5b8rC95VAQ5)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
